acid neutralization reaction simulation

I created this for my high-school chemistry class to give them an interactive app that would illustrate some of the ideas around a process in dynamic equilibrium.  

The gui allows you to add HCl, NaHCO3 and citric acid.  It also allows you to change the probabilities associated with the various reactions that can occur between these substances, including their composition and decomposition (association and dissociation) in water.  It would be easy to add a temperature parameter that would change the speed of the particles.

The current state of the simuation (how many molecules/ions of each substance are present) is shown and can be monitored; 

CO2 molecules "bubble out" (rise to top and disappear).
